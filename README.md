# EncryptionSocialSystem
## Description of the project
In this encryption system, a user is able to encrypt and decrypt their data as they see fit. What makes this system unique when compared to other systems is that users are able to share encrypted files with other users. Other users can then decrypt their files as well. This application was split into 3 layers as per the separation of concerns principle.
